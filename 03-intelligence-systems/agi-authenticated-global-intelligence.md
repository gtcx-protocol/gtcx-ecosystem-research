## Executive Summary

Authenticated Global Intelligence (AGI) represents the critical innovation that resolves the fundamental tension between national sovereignty and global market participation. AGI enables countries to maintain complete control over their commodity verification infrastructure while seamlessly connecting to international markets through a federated intelligence network.

The AGI architecture allows for both regional and national deployment models, ensuring that countries can choose their level of integration without surrendering control to external platforms. This specification defines the technical architecture, operational models, and implementation pathways for AGI as the gateway layer connecting sovereign national systems to global commodity markets.
